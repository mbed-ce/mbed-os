Three Mbed libraries live within this directory:
* `mbed-core-flags`     that includes RTOS headers what are necessry for full and also bare-metal profiles
* `mbed-rtos-flags`     that includes RTOS header for full profile only
* `mbed-rtos-sources`   that brings all source files for full profile only
